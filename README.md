# Anna's Powdertoy Clone

This is intended to be a Data-Oriented rewrite of powdertoy, in order to learn
how it works in order to apply it to a future game down the line

## Development Log

### 07-04-2022

- finished the basic sand implementation today, sand somewhat satisfyingly falls down
- fixed my broken git/github setup

### 23-05-2022

- started work on my new cell type which will allow for better structure to the
project in the future, and more types of block (hopefully).
- hopefully i will be able to do more work on this as i will be on break from uni
soon.
